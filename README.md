# MediaPipe X-Plane 11 Controller

This project uses **MediaPipe** to detect hand gestures and control the **X-Plane 11 flight simulator**. Hand gestures are mapped to flight controls such as throttle, elevator, and aileron, enabling intuitive and real-time control of the simulator.

## Features
- **Real-time hand gesture detection** using MediaPipe.
- **Flight control mapping** for throttle, pitch, and roll.
- Intuitive interface for controlling X-Plane 11 using hand gestures.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- XPlaneConnect

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mediapipe-xplane-controller.git
